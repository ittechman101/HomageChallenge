Homage Code Challenge for Vaccination Center App in Singapore
Kyle Wilson - 2022/03/17

## Challenge Description
COVID-19 is a global pandemic and to allow country wide activities to resume, vaccinations are introduced to decrease the death rate from the infection.
You are tasked to build a reservation system for COVID-19 vaccinations in Singapore. This means a user should at least be able to schedule their 1st vaccination dose. Each vaccination centre has a different number of nurses that work on different days; the amount of patients each centre can handle will differ.
The system should support following features:
- Support multiple vaccination centres in Singapore 
- Keep into account the daily supply of the nurses for each centre and their duty schedule
- Model the daily capacity of a centre and accordingly allocate the vaccination slots to the residents 
- Support CRUD operations for the slot reservation 
- Avoid double reservation (What happens if the same user books again?) 
- The solution should handle the resource contention (What happens if 2 different users book the same time slot?)
